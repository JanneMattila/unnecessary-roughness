# Rulebook

## Introduction

This document outlines the rules of "Unnecessary Roughness" later referred
just by "UR".

UR is based on historical football game called [Calcio Storico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcio_Fiorentino).

## Game system

### Turn based

TODO: Game last 50 turns (50 minutes).

### Scoring

TODO: 1 point for goal, ï¿½ to the opponent throws ball above the goal net.

### Board

TODO: 50 x 100 squares (50 x 100 meters).

### Dices

TODO: Mainly D100. Lower is better and in order to success you need
to throw below the target. Depending on the task you will always have
risk of failing big time if you roll high numbers. Typically 95-100
but in case there are modifiers it can be as low as 80 (very high extreme
failure risk).

## Players

TODO: Characteristics, skills and abilities. 
(Throwing, Catching, Wrestling, Hitting, Kicking, Screening, etc.),
(Strength, Agility, Speed, Aggressiveness, Endurance, Fatigue) 

TODO: 4 goal keepers, 3 fullbacks, 5 halfbacks, 15 forwards.

When players run, fight or wrestle then they consume fatigue points.
If low on fatigue point they cannot use those actions. Low fatigue
points also causes higher risk for injury. Fatigue points do recover
every turn.

### Movement

Player uses action before the move:

- Run (full movement, eats fatigue points)
- Move and prepare to defend (half of the movement)
- Fight (capable of making move next turn)
- Wrestle (you cannot easily leave opponent)

If player is running, they cannot perform any attack or defense actions.
